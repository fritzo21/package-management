dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest- 8.noarch.rpm

sudo yum install nginx


#Enable the nginx service
sudo systemctl enable nginx

#Start the nginx service
sudo systemctl start nginx

#Check the nginx service status
sudo systemctl status nginx

Rename default nginx cont file
sudo mv /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.bkp

Create nginx cont file in default path and define proxy(reverse proxy) rules.
sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf Add the below lines 

events{
worker_connections 1024;
}
http { keepalive_timeout 5;
upstream tomcatServers {
  keepalive 50;
  server 172.31.16.79:8080;
  server 172.31.28.14:8080;
  server 172.31.84.245:8080;

}
server {
   listen 80;
location / {
        proxy_set_header  X-Real-lP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header        Host $host;
        proxy_pass http://tomcatServers;
}
}
}

Node for upgrade/patching:
  server 172.31.16.79:8080;
  server 172.31.28.14:8080;
  server 172.31.84.245:8080 down;

Node should get more traffic:
  server 172.31.16.79:8080 weight=4;
  server 172.31.28.14:8080;
  server 172.31.84.245:8080 down;


Validate the nginx.conf by using below command
sudo nginx -t

Reload configurations
sudo nginx -s reload

Restart nginx Service to Reflect the proxy rules.

sudo systemctl restart nginx

Note: If you get 502 Bad Gateway

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a Linux kernel security module for Linux systems that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system. If SELinux enabled, which blocked Nginx from making outbound connections.

If SELinux is on and you're experiencing this, you might try setting httpd_can_network_connect to true, and then restarting nginx:

# setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect true

Choosing a Load-Balancing Method

Round Robin - Requests are distributed evenly across the servers, with server weights taken into consideration. This method is used by default

upstream backend {
# no load balancing method is specified for Round Robin server landmarktechtechnologies.app1.com;
server   landmarktechtechnologies.app2.com;
}

Least Connections - A request is sent to the server with the least number of active connections, again with server weights taken into consideration:

upstream backend { least_conn;
server mithuntechnologies.app1.com; server mithuntechnologies.app2.com;
}

IP Hash - The server to which a request is sent is determined from the client IP address. In this case, either the first three octets of the IPv4 address or the whole IPv6 address are used to calculate the hash value. The method guarantees that requests from the same address get to the same server unless it is not available.

upstream backend { ip_hash;
server mithuntechnologies.app1.com; server mithuntechnologies.app2.com;
}


If one of the servers needs to be temporarily removed from the
load-balancing rotation, it can be marked with the down parameter in order to preserve the current hashing of client IP addresses. Requests that were to be processed by this server are automatically sent to the next server in the group:

upstream backend {
server mithuntechnologies.app1.com; server mithuntechnologies.app2.com; server mithuntechnologies.app3.com down;
}

Server Weights:
By default, NGINX distributes requests among the servers in the group according to their weights using the Round Robin method. The weight parameter to the server directive sets the weight of a server; the default is 1:

upstream backend {
server mithuntechnologies.app1.com weight=5; server mithuntechnologies.app2.com;
server mithuntechnologies.app3.com backup;
}
In the example, mithuntechnologies.app1.com has weight 5; the other two servers have the default weight (1), but the one with domain name mithuntechnologies.app3.com is marked as a backup server and does not receive requests unless both of the other servers are unavailable. With this configuration of weights, out of every 6 requests, 5 are sent to mithuntechnologies.app1.com and 1 to mithuntechnologies.app2.com.

Tuning Your NGINX Configuration

The following are some NGINX directives that can impact performance. As stated above, we only discuss directives that are safe for you to adjust on your own. We recommend that you not change the settings of other directives without direction from the NGINX team.
